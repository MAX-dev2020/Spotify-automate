## Create playlist for your local music files and listen on every device

#### This is a personal project

## Why I built this program ?

#### 1. I wanted to list my local songs on spotify app and listen to them on all of my devices (Phone, TV, Car), but to do that I had to copy the local files onto all of my devices which is time/space consuming and a tedious task.

#### 2. If in case of you have a data loss, you might loose all your local files and your fav songs, so its better for you store it on your spotify app and listen everywhere.

#### 3. To do the above mentioned tasks, I had to manually **search** and **add** all of my songs to my spotify account one after one which is a hassle :unamused:

#### To solve the above problems I bulit **_Spotify-automate_**.

## How is my program helpful ?

As you know spotify has a feature called "Local Files". If you want to listen to your local songs everywhere then you need to store your songs on your all your devices .If you So to listen to your local songs on all your devices you have to search for the song manually and add it to your spotify playlist, but searching and adding 200 or 300 songs is a hassle. To solve this problem i built this program which searchs all your local songs and add to your spotify playlist.
