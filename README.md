## Create playlist for your local music files and listen on every device

### This is a personal project

## Why I built this program ?

### I wanted to listen to all my local songs on spotify and on all my other devices, but all the local music files is on my laptop and i can't play them on my TV or on my phone.

## How is my program helpful ?

### As your know spotify has a feature called "Local Files". If you want to listen to your local songs everywhere then you need to store your songs on your all your devices .If you So to listen to your local songs on all your devices you have to search for the song manually and add it to your spotify playlist, but searching and adding 200 or 300 songs is a hassle. To solve this problem i built this program which searchs all your local songs and add to your spotify playlist.
