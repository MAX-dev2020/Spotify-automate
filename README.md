# Spotify-automate-

## Create playlist for your local music files and listen on every device

#### This is a personal project

## Why I built this program?

#### 1. I wanted to list my local songs on spotify app and listen to them on all of my devices (Phone, TV, Car), but to do that I had to copy the local files onto all of my devices which is time/space consuming and a tedious task.

#### 2. If in case of you have a data loss, you might loose all your local files and your fav songs, so its better for you store it on your spotify app and listen everywhere.

#### 3. To do the above mentioned tasks, I had to manually **search** and **add** all of my songs to my spotify account one after one which is a hassle :unamused:

#### To solve the above problems I bulit **_Spotify-automate_**.

## How is my program helpful?

#### 1. **_Spotify-automate_** reads all your local music files.

#### 2. Searches all your local songs from the spotify database using spotify API references and adds them to a playlist.

#### 3. So this enables you to listen to all your local songs on any of your devices without having to have the local files on stored on the devices.
